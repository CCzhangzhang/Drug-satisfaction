I'm always very reluctant to seek medical help, but I finally got my answer: an overgrown endometrium (endometrial hyperplasia). I wanted to try this product because it's non-hormonal. This is my second month using this product, and it doesn't work for me. The first month I had my usual ridiculously heavy flow for five days of my 14-day period. I thought maybe it was a fluke and that I should try again. That was a waste of money.

My periods typically lasted 15-30 days prior to this medication, and now they last about 10-15. I still have very heavy bleeding with large clots (along with severe cramping), however this medication has helped with breaking up the clots, and decreasing the amount of days that are 'very heavy flow.' The only side effects I have experienced have been nausea and vomiting. The medication is prescribed for 5 days at 3x's/day, however, I take it 2x's/day for 7 to 8 days, and that has worked well for me. When I take it 3x's/day I will vomit, but at 2x's/day I only experience nausea. This medication has helped me more than hormone therapy has in terms of controlling heavy bleeding & clotting.

I asked my doctor for a prescription for a progesterone pill but she refused and thought that lysteda would be best for me. The reason why i desperately needed this pill was because i was flying out to las vegas to see my boyfriend for a week and it just so happen to be that i was supposed to get my period at that time. I'm not on birth control (but i should be) because i dont want my mother to think that im having sex etc. So i went to las vegas and for the first four days i was there i didnt get my period (thank god) and the fifth day i got it and took the pills that morning afternoon and night for the first few days of my period hoping that it would have some effect. Well, it didn't. I was so pissed off because i get terrible periods where i can't get out of bed and i'm really not a nice person and highly emotional and it's just not a good time for me. Plus i was staying with my boyfriend and thats so not fun if i have it.

It helped but it caused weight gain, hair loss, and prolonged spotting. So I did not do another one of those shots. I had the D&C surgery which ended up being expensive and a waste of time. I had to ask my OB-GYN about this medication because I saw the leaflet in the waiting room. He acted as though he did not want prescribe it. He said the only thing that would help me is a hysterectomy.  I plan to have one, but not this year so in the meantime I love taking Lysteda because it makes me feel like I have a normal period.

Well after using this drug for over a year, I woke up one morning and COULD NOT MOVE! I had a Charlie horse that would not go away and back pain out of this world! I went to the ER where they said I had sciatica (back pain where the pain also shoots down one or both legs). After being treated for a very slight herniated disk and sciatica my pain would always get worst during and after my period. Although I told both my neuro and my GYN about my theory about this drug they both did said that they didn't know if it was the cause but it was unlikely. Tired, exhausted and frustrustrated I was faced with two choices...stop taking this drug and go back to being a slave to my period or get a partial hysto.

Ruining clothing, sleeping with a towel in the bed, cramping severly with large blood clots. Birthcontrol pills had the reverse effect on me causing me to bleed 3 weeks on and 1 week off. So no good. Finally, years later a doctor finally recognized the help I needed and suggested Lysteda and I love it. Now I only use 1 package of pads with some left over. My life is on again. I can enjoy outings with my husband and children without panic of changing a pad and tampon within 30 minutes.

What was unusual was I felt a contraction type feeling the 3rd morning after I took the Lysteda that lasted about a 1/2 hour. The contraction feeling was not painful, just freaky. No other unusual side effects noted at this time. The number of days on cycle were as usual. My flow was reduced by 50% or more. I was not tied to a bathroom like I usually am on days 2-5! I messed up on the dosage the first day and only took one 650mg tablet in the morning and afternoon. Taking only one had reduced it some (like 20%) but not as much as it did once I got my actual prescription and noticed I needed to take two 650mg tablets, three times a day. My doctor prescribed it correctly, I had forgotten how many she said. It seemed like it would be a lot to remember taking the meds at first, but if someone has a vested interest such as I, you don't forget...believe me! I did start the meds on day 2 and stopped at bedtime on day 5, my doctor says however I should start taking them on day 1. I am not a big fan of taking medication for anything, but I recommend Lysteda because it was very freeing. I will try to remember to post updates after continued usage, especially if I develop side-effects. I've found the reviews of others very helpful to me.  

Note for medical professionals: A strange occurance that may be linked to the contraction type feeling on morning 3. I had two ultra sounds. One about a week after my last period ended and one two days after this past period ended (lysteda usage) and the technician told me my uterus was significantly smaller in size.

I recently tried Lysteda (1300 mg 3 x's a day for 5 days.  It did significantly reduce the bleeding, but I felt very week and tired and I am anemic, so I am not sure if this is the best choice for me.

As for the person who said it did  not help after your 3rd cycle, you stated that you took 650 mgs 3 times per day. If that is correct, you are not taking enough.

Used to need to change every 45-60 minutes.  Impossible to sleep at night like that! Very little side effects.  Sort of feels like a migraine aura, but migraine never develops.  After 6 months, I have noticed a decrease in flow even without pills.  I rated ease of use a 4 because you have to take so many pills, but a very small inconvenience for the benefit of getting my life back.

I felt physically drained and afraid to leave the house. My normal periods before the IUD were 4 to 5 days and a super plus tampon would last the normal 4-6 hours. My gyno gave me a sample Lysteda and it really helped. It reduced the bleeding to a much more normal and manageable flow, like it used to be before the IUD. The awful cramps also are less intense. It's sort of a pain to remember to take all three doses during the day but it's worth the effort. I do feel a few side effects but nothing serious at all. I feel thirsty and very tired..to the point where I feel the need to nap. But that often happens with a period anyway. I have a headache which also happens with my period so it might not be the Lysteda. Other than that I'm happy that I tried it and will stick with it, despite the fairly high cost.

Normally my periods are 7 full days of bleeding.  Days 2-4 I usually wore heavy/overnight pads & super size tampon that I had to change almost every hour around the clock, or I would risk bleeding through everything in sight.  My period this month was due when I was on vacation (of course!), so it showed up the moment we got to our destination.  Using Lysteda, I was able to enjoy myself- swimming, sports activities, sleeping comfortably- w/o being paranoid about where the nearest bathroom was and w/o wondering if I was going to feel a mortifying gush of blood at any moments notice.  It does not stop bleeding all together, but I would say I had a 50% or more decrease.  I used probably 1/4 the number of tampons & pads I usually would.  Taking the pills was not a problem, and after day 5, when you stop taking them, my period just abruptly ended.  I had no noticeable side effects.  I am interested to see if my period will get even more tolerable as I continue taking the pills.  Worth a try in my opinion if your period incapacitates you every month like mine did!

It wasn't light either, my period was very very heavy and lasted for the rest of the month.

I'm 33 and have suffered from abnormally long and heavy periods(up to 3 weeks long, talk about being depressed) for the last 13 years. I have tried multiple hormone and birth control pills, even tried the bio-identicals and nothing worked. I had been to multiple doctors in the NYC area and none of them could figure out what was going on. 10 months ago my doctor suggested taking Lo Loestrin Fe since it had a very low dose of estrogen, 10mcg. The first 2 months I spotted and was emotionally a little off but I can happily say I have not had a period since and since I've suffered with constant periods for the last 13 years I welcomed NO PERIODS! Besides being able to have a normal sex life again, I lost 10 pounds. All of the bloating and sugar cravings went away. I used to wake up in the morning thinking about what I was going to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and now I'm not thinking about food all day long. I also feel like my metabolism has revved up. I can still eat my ice cream and have my snacks but it doesn't stick to my thighs like it used to. It has been a wonderful change. The only downside is my skin has lost it's glow and I'm constantly breaking out. In the past I maybe had 1 breakout a year now the minute 1 pimple goes away 2 more pop out. I also started getting yeast infections, 1 every couple of months. Starting in January I'm going to switch to the Loestrin 20 which has 20mcg of estrogen and see if that helps with my skin and hopefully keep periods light.

I am perimenopausal and have been using this to treat the symtoms.  One being irregular and heavy periods.  I have taken MANY BC pills -one by one I would experience breakthrough bleeding - then bleed HEAVILY for a week.  I was started on Natazia to have shorter and lighter ""periods"" during the time I would have a scheduled period (placebo pills).  

I have been on this medication for a year and 1/2 and unfortunately I can't say I have ""regulated"" yet!  

I will have several days of no spotting - then several days of spotting.  Sometimes my periods are two days - light.  And then sometimes - around the 3rd month I have a 12 day period!  Awful!  I will have begun the next pill pack - and I will still bleed into the second week of te pack. 

I will say - you MUST take this pill no more than 14 hours apart.  Try, try, try to not forget or skip or start your pill pack late.  Be very regimented!  

Still - I've done that and had a several day period. 

Yes - Acne.  For a while I didn't experience it - but now very bad on my chin.  Not all the time - it comes and goes. 

Breat tenderness - funny - I had not experience it at all - not much - then this past month they have been VERY tender and swollen (that's not a bad side effect!) 

I haven't had the headaches. (knock on wood!)

Mood swings...no more than usual. 

Still spotting...usually heavier spotting the last week before my ""period"" starts.  

I will say one thing no one has spoken about - odor.  When I was taking other pills  - when I would spot or have my period I would get that ""period odor"" - we all know how it goes.  

NO ODOR on this pill!!!  I read where it ""alters the chemistry of the cervical mucus"" - must be what is happening.  And that is a BIG plus for me.  I do NOT like to smell!!

I finally discovered that all my anxiety problems/panic attacks started after I began taking this pill and immediately stopped taking it.  With my other BCs I rarely had side effects.  After having the panic attacks I completely stopped all BCs out of fear of having such side effects again.  About a week after stopping Natazia, all my anxiety was gone.

I would be off for a week and then bleed again. Also had horrible pain that was affecting my life. Had so much nausea I lost weight like crazy and was down to 95lbs. Had tried just about every other type of birth control pill.
 I started taking it on the first day of my period. It was way lighter right away and stopped after 5 days! Cramps eased up. The nausea was worse at first but within about a week it went away. I've gained an appropriate amount of weight- back up to 115 which I consider my healthy weight. The worst part of taking it was that it made me exhausted. I literally slept like 15 hours a day the first week I took it. I had a really hard time getting through a shift at work. (It was still worth it to not be in excruciating pain.) Within a couple weeks that seemed to get better too, though I'm still not back to my normal energy level.
 I find that I have to be really careful to take it at the same time every day. Within half hour late of taking it, I get cold sweats, dizzy, nauseated. Then when I take it I get so tired like when I first started taking it and I'll pass out for a good 12-15 hours. 
I was worried about being crazy moody and emotional on it or growing excess hair but no problem w either of these. Overall really happy with this. It got results that no other med achieved for me.

It seemed to me that I was more normal then because it regulated my periods from what it used to be...(lets say the worst was 3 months straight and VERY heavy...basically I had to miss school because I practically lived in the bathroom...)

For two months, I didn't sleep, I was constantly sick to my stomach, my head hurt all the time, and my periods were still painful and heavy. When I returned to pick up my third month, I told Walgreen's that I wanted the Mononessa that my OB-GYN described. With Mononessa, my periods are a different story...I typically get my period on the third or fourth day of my ""period pills"" and other than an overwhelming and extremely heavy start, it's usually pretty light. I do still have a lot of pain, even though the blood is almost nothing. I am a week ahead of schedule though and I am not really a fan of that.

I was so desperate for this to work and was excited to have it fitted. I explicitly stated that I wanted something that DID NOT cause weight GAIN as I have worked hard to reach my perfect BMI over the last 2 years. I was informed that it would NOT cause weight gain. The insertion was really painful (and I mean really painful) but I was glad that I had it fitted. Immediately I had major contraction pains which took my breath away. These went on for nearly two months. I also had an insatiable hunger. This lasted for 3 months and then happened every 2 weeks thereafter. I also bled seriously heavily for the first 3 weeks and then had light bleeding every. Back and hip pain was also a permanent fixture from day 1 of insertion. I also had mood swings which made me feel very anxious and angry and my hair started falling out. I've never had an of this in my entire life! I went for a check up to make sure that everything was ok and that the coil was still in the correct position and was informed that it was. After three months, the bleeding calmed down to every 3 weeks, but my stomach was ALWAYS bloated and really uncomfortable every day with mild and sometimes severe cramps. My stomach looked like I was expecting twins, really embarrassing especially as it used to be flat. I then weighed my self. Despite not putting on weight in 3 years and in fact losing it over that time, I'd gained 12 pounds within 4 months of having the coil fitted, seriously not good. I was doing exactly the same amount of activity and eating the same things as I had done over the past 3 years. It is now January 2019.

Intercourse was no longer painful. The constant spotting stopped entirely. The bloating in my lower abdomen disappeared. It was a transformation that was obvious. While my gyno had been suggesting therapy, all I needed was to have the Mirena removed. Don't get me wrong, at the time it served its purpose but at some point, it became a negative and no medical professional thought to eliminate it. I'm happy to say after having the Mirena removed, I am off the list for a hysterectomy with normal periods. Fortunately I don't require it for birth control as my husband has had a vasectomy.

How I wish I had done this when I was 20, it has changed my life. PMT/PMS has calmed down, there is spotting but that clears up and now I barely notice when having a period.

I thought I could feel it for the first week or so but maybe it was just settling down, any discomfort was short lived. 

Over the last 30 years I have passed out and vomited at work, at train stations, public toilets, swimming pools, friends houses etc.... Missed weddings, birthdays, holidays and other special/fun occasions.  I could also never eat properly around my period, had to eat very little and basic food, yoghurt and cereal for a few days.

This has changed everything. 

I haven't had any children and was advised the fitting would be more painful. It wasn't pleasant, I felt sick, hot and very ill but for only 40/50 SECONDS - this is bearable and helps if you put some things into place before your appointment. I have listed below for anyone interested.

At least give it a try there is nothing to lose, it can always be removed

Good luck x

Prior preparation:

I started taking a magnesium supplement a couple of weeks before my appointment, it helps with muscle cramping and relaxing. I had an epsom salt bath prior to the fitting, again for the magnesium.

I took some IBS anti-spasmodic supplements, to help with related cramping.

Lastly, 30 mins before fitting I took painkillers.

When my period came, it was as bad as usual, no change in pain level. The following 2 months were okay, except I would still get my periods for 6 to 9 days. But this time, the cramps lasted the entire period but were not nearly as bad; it would hurt but I was still able to function. But then, at the beginning of June (around month 4), I started experiencing regular sharp, horrible pain in my lower abdomen coupled with non stop spotting with blood clots and it kept on getting worse day after day. I told my OBGYN, but he said I could just be experiencing the side effects and not to worry, but I know my body enough to know that this was not normal. Went to my family doctor to double check and as he was trying to verify that the IUD was in place, he couldn't find it. After a painful half hour research down there, he ended finding it. Turns out it was a case of rejection, so he took it out immediately and after that, I had one of the most painful, horrible periods I've ever had, having every symptom from pain to migraines to uncontrollable vomiting (I couldn't even hold it in long enough to reach the washroom)...

I literally have to take hot baths for 2 days straight and no OTC meds help with the cramps. I was going to get the Mirena 4 years ago, but after reading on line about how much it hurts going in and the horror story side effects, I opted out. But now I cant take it. So I got it today.Waiting in the docs office with clammy hands. I was so scared of nothing! IT REALLY DIDN'T HURT! That was it? No screaming, no crying, no grabbing the table in pain, nothing. Just the pressure (not pain) of the doc pushing on my cervix and the speculum being held open. And I'm the biggest baby when it comes to pain. It was all on my head. I've passed blood clots that have hurt worst. I would recommend taking headphones and music to relax yourself. I sang the whole time due to nerves. The doc just laughed, but it helped. I drove myself to Jamba Juice and home right after. Whole thing took 5min tops!

So my point is its not as bad as the complaints say. I guess most people who have good experiences don't waste their time writing a review because they are living life, but bad experiences stick out.

The first 3 months on Mirena were bad--constant period for about 8 weeks. At about the 3 month mark, I had a horrible mood swings and contemplated suicide. I came online and discovered that mood swings were part of the side effects and I've been fine ever since. (Knowing what was causing them was very helpful.) (I'd never had that problem with PMS--just when I was pregnant.) The 4 years since then have been AWESOME! No pain, and I've had probably 3 periods total and they were very light.

No other side effects but it did not work.  My period turned from 7 days to 17 days on average, with such irregular bleeding - one month I had 4 days off in total so it definitely did not work.  The periods were lighter for sure, but double the length which was not the objective.  In the 5th month it fell out on it's own during a period so it certainly didn't work.

Since my periods were so heavy, it didn't stop it, it reduced it, which was still WONDERFUL. And the bonus for me was that it would probably take me through to menopause!

Nuvaring was wonderful for my moods and regulated my cycle, but couldn't keep me from bleeding during extremely stressful times.  On Mirena, I've had my period maybe four times and it's super light.  The BEST thing about it is that my moods have improved dramatically.  I've cried less times in the last year than since my period began.  Once every few months vs. once every few days.

The device did solve the problem of bleeding and maybe one or two partial cycles and nothing since for over two years.  Upon 1st annual pelvic check up the strings to the device could no longer be located.  We then had to do an ultrasound to check for possible expulsion and learned it was still in proper place.  Thus leaving me to pay in full for the ultrasound cost which was deemed not medically necessary.  Now I have been advised I am menopausal and the device needs to be surgically removed in the operating room.  Possibly deductibles and other expenses I never took into consideration upon getting this device.  Seems that strings retraction is a common occurence, maybe this should be mentioned prior to placement so costs could be considered in the event of this happening.

Look forward to getting this out as early as possible in 2011 and hopefully not experiencing some of the unwanted symptoms.

First, insertion was excrutiating, but after an hour I was fine.  Within a month I had a blister on my gut? turn into a horrible staph infection.  Antibiotics (AB) for a 2 months along with trips to a wound specialist.  While recovering from that, I got pneumonia, with double ear infection and strep throat at the same time. Never had any of those.  3 mos after insertion, I start raking at my labia,first thought it was yeast, dr. said it was female eczema, itching still continues and have been prescribed 3 diff creams with only temp relief.  Multiple sinus infections, and the start of bronchitis when I couldn't breathe, more (AB).  11 mos after insertion (Now) have a UTI that will not heal, and have run out of AB, 10 days worth.  Called dr today and am having it removed in 4 days.  Aside from the infections, zero sex drive, cannot lose weight, severe backaches, extreme hairloss(as told by my stylist), very emotional, I rarely spotted and had minimal cramps.

But after reading so many negative reviews of Mirena (that almost discouraged me from getting one myself), I decided to add myself into the chorus of voices that have had a positive experience with this form of bc.  This is not to invalidate the bad experiences some women have had with this method, but to let women interested in Mirena know that bad experiences are a small minority, and overrepresented on this site.  I have  suffered with dysmenorrhea for 20 years, since my first period, and was not only looking for a highly effective bc, but something that could help manage the pain (monthly vomiting, diarrhea, occasional fainting). Mirena has done that for me.  My first period has come and gone, and the pain was cut in half.  I imagine it will continue improve. I do want to say that while the insertion was fairly easy for me(I had a shot of lidocaine in my cervix, which also helps dilate it), the first month (especially the first week) was definitely uncomfortable. The cramps never got as bad as during my period, but they were definitely no walk in the park. Schedule your insert at a time when you have few demanding activities or work for at least a few days.

I was not sure if I should continue to take the pill because I thought the pill was causing all this bleeding.  My doctor also suggesting a shot very similar to the ""depo"" shot but this shot actually puts you in a state of menopause for a few months but she said once I am done with that after three months my cycle is suppose to come back much worse than before....So I wasn't sure if I should get the shot which I believe was called Lupron...Has anyone ever had that before?

Even if I had, I, like many of you probably would have discounted them.  The insertion process was exceptionally difficult-- with my doctor becoming very stressed and frustrated and having to insert some contraption to ‚Äústabilize‚Äù my uterus. It was very painful.  It took about an hour, and my doctor said she was thankful I was on my period, otherwise she could not have inserted Mirena at all.   The next three weeks were also problematic.  After the first week and a half of extreme pain I finally went to the ER thinking that the lining of my uterus had been perforated (punctured).  After all the tests, I was surprised to find that everything was ‚Äúokay‚Äù with the IUD.  I am not a wimp about pain.  I have degenerative spine disease so I am in pain every day and often in extreme pain.  The pain from this IUD was bad enough that I went to the ER.  The second problem is the resulting depression and weight gain.  I am normally a very happy upbeat person, but have been consistently depressed since I got Mirena, and now it is so bad that I was considering going to get depression medication(!)  The ironic thing is that there hasn‚Äôt been any change to my life, and there is absolutely no reason for me to be depressed.  In addition, I have been hungry ALL the time.  It used to be that I would have a crazy appetite for a few days before my period, but now, that is the norm.  I‚Äôve only gained about 8 lbs, but that is by fighting it all the time.  I‚Äôm thankful for all your reviews, because otherwise I would not have been so sure it was the Mirena.  For those of you who are ‚Äòblaming the victim‚Äô in your reviews, be thankful you have not been adversely affected, but never assume that their (our) symptoms are not real.  I will have the Mirena IUD removed in the next few weeks and I will report back.  ",1,Female,"Pain, bleeding, or  dizziness  during and after placement of the device may occur.",6

I definatly would get another in the future, price per year its well worth it!!! My will-be-husband is quite large and said he never ""felt"" the strings during intercourse, I had no worries about forgetting to take it, and when I would spot, it became like clock work every month same day start.

Ok, so I was on Sprintec birth control for about 3 years after having an ovarian cyst rupture. Sprintec controlled that problem, and it regulated my period, and, of course, it worked as a birth control (I assume, though I use condoms as well). Now, I didn't like the idea of being on my period for 6-7 days while most other females around me were having 4-5 day periods, so I asked around to see which birth controls were best for shortening/lightening periods. I came across Microgestin through a friend of mine. The first month I had started, it was like heaven for me. I had a day of light bleeding and that was it! The second month is when it started to get worse for me. On the 3rd week of active pills, I started spotting. I spotted until the week in which I was to have my actual period. I bled straight through for two weeks.I have always read that one needs to give a birth control at least 3 months to adjust to your body. I gave it 5. It just got worse and worse. Random bleeding throughout the month, unusually moody, and I always felt fatigued? I have finally decided that 6-7 days of a period is  better than spotting and then a period. Only good thing I found about this pill was that my boobs seem to have grown a bit. I don't recommend this pill to anyone. I read a lot of bad reviews on it before I decided to take it, and I should've listened.",1,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  headache ,  bloating ,  breast  tenderness, swelling of the  ankles /feet (fluid retention), or  weight  change may occur.",0

Since the mirena, my labibdo remains high, no weight gain, migraines haven't increased, periods are much lighter, OH but there is a big BUT!!! Since 10/10 I will have what appears to be periods for at least 3 to 10 days twice a month and most of the time without any warning. Now the procedure was 20 mins but it was guided ultrasound, it felt a little bit more uncomfortable then a pap, holding my inhaling and exhaling when my doc told me to helped. Its something one has to weigh their pros and cons and the reasoning for using this device. I will say that I am exploring other another option that does not involve the use of any non/hormonal drugs,or insertions of devices. I am either going to keep the Mirena or go the surgical route.",3, ,"Pain, bleeding, or  dizziness  during and after placement of the device may occur.",2

Insertion of the IUD was a little painful and spotting for a 2 days after then nothing. My periods so far are great; light bleeding and spotting and thats it. I wish I've done this sooner. Plus my sex drive had increased since being on it my husband loves it too. I can't praise the Mirena enough for giving back my life.

19-24,Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods,6/18/2012,mirena intrauterine device,20420,5,4,"If you are considering Mirena, do NOT be scared off by negative reviews! Read on for details, but I certainly don't think there's remotely enough pain involved to avoid this device, at least not if you have a competent doctor!

I'm almost 23, and - after extensive research - asked to be prescribed Mirena to treat my very irregular periods since suffering a second trimester miscarriage 2 years ago. The birth control aspect is a major plus. I had Mirena inserted almost 2 weeks ago, which is the only reason I only gave it 4 stars for effectiveness, as I haven't had it long enough yet to judge that.

For those worried about the pain... don't be. Insertion was certainly not comfortable, but it was far from unbearable, at least for someone like me who has been pregnant in the past. For the record, I did not have any pain killers before or right after insertion, and it was performed 4 days into my cycle. Dilation of my cervix did not hurt one iota. The clamp used to pull the uterus into the proper position for insertion causes moderate cramping, so that wasn't too pleasant, but was not even as bad as period cramps. The only point where I felt even noteworthy pain was the brief ""pop"" when the insertion device made it around a bend in my uterus that had been causing the doctor trouble... that was a fairly sharp jolt of pain for a few seconds, but it wasn't tear-jerking or anything like that. As soon as the clamp, speculum, and inserter were removed, I felt nothing but very mild cramping which lasted one day and went away the second I took a Midol.

I spotted very lightly (only a nickel-sized dot in a pantyliner every few hours) for the first week, and now only notice light traces of blood when I wipe. I have not had any pain related to the Mirena since. I cannot detect any side effects from the hormones. I can't feel the device at all, except for the strings if I check for them, and they're very unobtrusive. They even get softer with time.

Mirena is great so far!",5,Female,"Pain, bleeding, or  dizziness  during and after placement of the device may occur.",5

This prompted a visit to my GYN. An ultrasound in March 2010 found that I had now developed cysts in my right ovary, my fibroids had grown and my uterus went from being 8x8 in Sept 09 to 12x8. My 2month follow-up in May 2010 found that the cysts have almost doubled in size, the fibroids have grown more and my uterus is now 16x8. Based on blood tests, I have no sign of cancer. My visit to the GYN Oncologist today ended with the decision to remove my right ovary and uterus. The doctors have NOT said that these problems are related to the Mirena however, I did not suffer from problems of this magnitude before the Mirena. I discovered my fibroids in 1996. 14 years and 2 children later, they remained slow growing and unproblematic with the exception of the heavy periods. The rapid growth occurring in my body at this time comes without definitive  explanation however, I find it questionable that these problems began shortly after the device was inserted.

(My periods were 10-12 days long, and I would go through at least 2 boxes of super sized tampons.)  Honestly, the procedure itself was the worst pain I have ever felt, I almost passed out from it.  I was given a prescription for 800 mg ibuprofen to take during and after, it didn't help much.  The aftermath wasn't much better, I had moderate to severe cramping off and on for about a month afterwards.  I had light to moderate bleeding for 5 weeks afterwards.  
I have now had Mirena for 10 weeks and I never thought I'd say it, but I love it.  I think I've had one period, but it was so light, I wasn't sure if I was spotting or what.  I haven't gained any weight (and I like to eat) and no complexion or personality changes like others have complained about. I don't know if it's relevant, but I didn't experience any of those side effects when I was on the pill many years ago either.
So, in summary:  if you are considering this option and haven't given birth, see if you can get some kind of stronger pain med, and be patient with the cramps and bleeding afterward.  I have been very pleased and look forward to easier periods for the next 5 years!

I had it put in when my son with 10 months old after a V-BAC. I felt only very mild discomfort and had minimal cramping that night and tinges the next day. Very little spotting as well.

Amazing. Last month I had to use a super plus tampon each hour for two days and nights. Now I may only use two for the entire event! I feel so much better while on my period.

As for the rest of you I really do wish all goes well as the mirena CERTAINLY is a blessing for some women. In regards to weight gain GET OVER IT. There are things A WHOLE LOT WORSE!!!

At first I thought it was due to stress and some changes in my life (new job, move to a different state). It's now 1 year later and nothing has changed. It has made me a total ""basket case"" at times and my relationship with my husband is suffering. Thank god he is so understanding. My hair has thinned to the point that I am actually considering a hair transplant. It's taken over my life. I am getting this thing removed ASAP.

This birth control method is definitely not attractive and as soon as I am able to, this thing is coming out.  The only positive thing I can say about Mirena is that it has kept me from getting pregnant, other than that its the worst and I don't recommend it to anyone.

35-44,Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods,12/29/2011,mirena intrauterine device,20420,5,5,"I was on depo for ten years and decided to transition to the Mirena due to some negative side effects from the shot. I travel across ten time zones on a routine basis so the pill was not a viable option, and did not want the random bleeding from the implant. I read many reviews before getting the Mirena and almost backed out based on the negative reviews. I am so glad I went through with the procedure.I have not had children, but have a history of severe and demobilizing cramping associated with periods. Therefore, my pain threshold is fairly high. 

The insertion was not bad at all. There are two uncomfortable times during the insertion - one when the sounding is done and again when the device is inserted. The pain only lasted for about 20 seconds with each step. Thus, I found this to be very bearable. Who can't handle 40 seconds of pain? What probably made this event a non-event was the prep work I did before the procedure. First, my doc prescribed a cervix softener which I placed intra-vaginally the night before and then the morning of the procedure. Second, I took OTC pain medicine starting the night prior. Third, I found a doctor who had a lot of experience placing the device. Overall, these steps probably helped tremendously. 

It appears that the depo left my system very quickly, probably because I have a high metabolism owing to my 10+ mile runs every day. I note a normal cycle except my period last for about two hours each month, which is a tremendous relief from my long and painful periods.

I did not have many negative side effects from the shot (same hormone as the Mirena), and do not notice any difference with the Mirena. The progesterone can aid in weight gain, but only by increasing your hunger. Thus, you must control how much you are eating and exercising while on this drug rather than simply blaming the medicine.

Overall, long-term solutions such as the shot and Mirena have given me my life back. Don't be afraid of all of the negative reviews.",5,Female,"Pain, bleeding, or  dizziness  during and after placement of the device may occur.",4

When I got it put in I lost about 10lbs within the first week. And the drs say that within 3 months I'll have regular periods and they might even stop too, the medicine is only for sirtent people. But as a young female j would recommend this to anybody with bleeding problems and before this the clots were sizes up to a small orange, and heavy bleeding were u could walk a foot without something happening. So girls if u had problems like me trust me do it and you'll do fine. I did have cramping and little pain but it's normal it went way after I think 4 days.

This pill made me lose vision. My contacts were 6.0 and 6.5, then after a year I went to the eye doctor and paid out of pocket because I could tell something was off. I didn't connect it to the sprintec though. I just thought it had been several years since going to the eye doctor, so my prescription changed. Then a few months ago, I went to the eye doctor again, a different one- and he mentioned casually, your prescription shouldn't change much at your age. and yet it had gotten worse, is now 7.0 and 7.5. After that visit I finally connected the dots, and realized that this drug has caused loss of vision. They had asked me at the clinic if I had loss of vision but I didn't know what that meant. I thought it meant blacking out. Years later when my head had cleared a little I was able to put this together.

Other side effects I have had with sprintec is that my legs feel strange, like there is not enough circulation in there. They are a little numb. It is frightening. I also gained weight, though I attribute that also to the workout I was doing-- a lot of people in my gym class seemed to be blowing up in their stomachs. 

I experienced a loss of libido, though this I didn't mind because I am single and don't have anyone to do that with- it was always more a distraction anyway so in a way sprintec helped with that one. You could go on the pill and then go off it when you get a bf. 

My hair also has fallen out a lot over the last several years, but I think that is only partially because of sprintec- I remember my mother's hair fell out a lot in her 30's also. I think my hair loss started when I started getting heavy periods several years ago, due to the fibroids. And it has continued.

I am going to stop taking it this week.  The weight gain and moods are not worth it, not to mention the headaches and cramps.  I think its more of a risk for the problem I have than the benefits, which the only thing it has done is decreased flow but the other things are NOT worth dealing with.  thought it would work better but does not.

It would hurt to sit down or even get up. I would go through 2 pads, in which I had stacked to prevent a leakage, in about an hour. TWO PADS! There had to be a solution. I researched ways to help, and oral contraceptives was the only option, after a long time waiting for the approval from my parents; my doctor prescribed me this. This is the end of my second week taking Sprintec and yes, I'm new to this, but this medicine has made me MISERABLE. I was a Sunday Starter and took the pill around 7pm. The next morning, I felt extremely nauseous and vomited. The nausea wouldn't go away until I started my second week. I even had to leave school early. Then the side effects changed to a terrible case of diarrhea, I would have to go several times an hour. It lasted about 4 miserable days. So the most important thing is that my cramps are still very present and VERY painful. I had built up a resistance to ibuprofen and the only thing that somewhat helped was acetaminophen(Pamprin). My main need of taking this pill was to regulate my heavy period and stop my cramps,or at least minimize them. It is now Saturday and I have officially had my period for a WEEK. Honestly, this pill has done nothing but make me feel bloated, probably gain a pound or two, break out into horrible acne, and an inevitable heavy and painful period. NOTHING has changed. Yes, it could take a little while for my body to get used to it, but I don't feel good on this pill. I spoke to my doctor and she changed my prescription to Junel 1/20. Hopefully it is going to work! I wish everyone luck and I good experience, I hope yours doesn't turn out like mine.

Long story short I did have bleeding on my wedding day.  As time has progressed I've noticed my periods are more regular, not lining up with the pills exactly but I am having a period every month unlike before where it would be months at a time.  My periods are shorter only 5 days instead of the 8-10 before and they are lighter than they were before.  I haven't had acne problems or headaches.

Now - I am 40 years old. I am expecting things to go a little out of control but this was severely impacting my life. 

In February 2010, I went to my doctor because I was anemic and exhausted from the constant battle with this issue. My doctor prescribed progestrone to hopefully stop the cycles and help me to get back on track. This made things worse and my anemia was very bad. I was ghostly white, no energy, and missing work because of pain. 

I was prescribed a new drug named Seasonique. Seasonique stops mentral cycles for 3 months at a time which was what I needed to fix the anemia and low energy. It worked. I had energy, was hitting the gym 4-5 times a week and I felt great. With my long awaited vacation coming up where I had 5 days at home and a 4 day hiking trip planned, I needed this. 

One month later, my doctor noticed some superficial blood clots in my lower left leg. No big deal. An aspirin a day would take it away. 

Another 20 days later, I get a doppler, an ultrasound of the veins, which informs me that I have some very big and bad blood clots that were very serious in my left leg. Immediately, I was pulled off the Seasonique and on April 28th, I was given Lovenox shots to inject myself with and Coumadin. 

April 30th, I was placed on bedrest for the weekend as my doctor suspected something more but couldn't get me into the specialist until Monday, May 3rd. 

May 3rd, I go to the doctor and was immediately hospitalized with a CT of the chest within hours of admission. They found several blood clots in both of my lungs. I was in bad shape whereas the week before I had felt great.

The horrible cramps only happened that one night, but I've just noticed that my last period was much lighter and half the time it normally lasts (used to go through a super tampon in 2 hours and lasted 1-2 weeks.. now a super tampon every 6 hours or so and about 4-5 days).

After a few months on tri-nessa I began getting very irritable, almost irrational on a regular basis.  The smallest thing would set me off.  I also began experiencing horrible anxiety. To top it off, I lost my sex drive.  I went from having a very healthy sexual appetite to nothing at all.  I began to think that it was just hormonal changes that you go through when growing up.  I had just turned 23 when I switched to trinessa, so I figured this was me growing out of my young-adult stage and into adulthood.  When I went to my annual exam over a year later, the topic of my lack of sex drive and anxiety came up.  The doctor then asked me if I was having mood swings.  She also asked if I was having frequent headaches and I told her I was.  She said that we needed to switch me back to Tri-sprintec.  She wrote me a prescription for Tri-sprintec specifically.  The pharmacy didn‚Äôt have any initially, but they apparently were willing to order some for me since it was SPECIFICALLY prescribed to me by my doctor.  After just one month on Tri-sprintec my mood stabilized and my sex drive was back in full force.  I never knew a drug could have this big of side effects, but I am here to say that if you have any problems on Tri-Nessa, please speak with your doctor!

I developed formication (the feeling of bugs crawling on the skin) that made me intensely paranoid, and it itched, all over my body. I have had barely any appetite felt so constantly nauseous that I have lost weight from not eating as much (around 3-5 lbs). I will be switching to a birth control patch in around a week after I have finished this round of tilia fe.

25-34,Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods,1/26/2015,amethia,156569,5,4,"I started using Amethia in November.  My doctor didn't want me to have a period for 3 months after I had 2 surgeries in October and November.  I needed the surgeries to remove multiple fibroids that were in the uterus on the endometrium line.  This caused VERY heavy bleeding with extremely large clots.  It was very painful. My period since August 2014 would last for 2 weeks and the only way to stop it was to go to the ER and be admitted.  It caused me to have 3 blood transfusions since and made me anemic.  Having said that, Amethia stopped my period and has allowed me to have 3 period free months.  I'm very happy that it has stopped but there are some side effects that started in the second month.  I have noticed that my hair was thinning out a lot, my face broke out really bad and my mood swings were unpleasant...for everybody.  When I relaized it was the birth control I mellowed out and am now able to control my moods better.  There was also brown discharge...not so sure if it's left over blood or not.  I would bleed a little after I tried to have sex.  i kinda stopped having sex after that so that there wouldn't be anymore breakout bleeding. By the middle of the 3rd month the side effects started to subside.  Also, the spotting ( with no sex) was once a day for the first month until I decided to workout.  The spotting stopped after 7 days of yoga and ab exercises.  To make sure that it was the workout that was helping I stopped working out and after 3-4 days the spotting continued.  Started working out again and after a few days it stopped again.  But now since I'm only 1 week away from having my period the spotting has come back and it's kinda heavy, 2 times a day, and I have cramps but I'm ok.  I have yet to see how this period is going to be.  Hopefully it's not out of control and goes away once I start the new pack. I will make an update to let you all know what happens.  I hope this review helps someone and wish everyone the best.",4,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  headache ,  bloating ,  breast  tenderness, swelling of the  ankles /feet (fluid retention), or  weight  change may occur.",0

GYN suggested this, but warned me that it could initially start prolonged light bleeding and eventually nothing. The first three months were miserable-bleeding every single day (not as bad as my heavy periods, but still needing maxis. I decided to give it six months and then I was going to quit. By month four, every bit of bleeding stopped, and I had no bleeding or period until I hit the one year mark and then the bleeding started again for about one month, and then it stopped until I hit the two year mark, and then it was light bleeding for about three weeks. Fast forward to five years later, and I have not had any bleeding since the second year mark-no period, nothing! This has been a blessing. Yes, the first three months were miserable, but it eventually faded and I no longer have a period. I have checked with my GYN and she said there is no reason to stop taking this (even for a short time) just  for me to have a period as I am getting proper estrogen/progesterone levels.

Though I did notice some mood swings and periodically I will randomly cry or be mad for no reason. Another negative is my sex drive went down tremendously.. I used to be the one who would always want it now I have to force myself to want to have sex sometimes which honestly sucks.

My doctor told me to just keep taking it at the same time every day.  It has now been about 4 or 5 months so I have had a period.  It is ABSOLUTE HEAVEN!  I was in pain every day, it was making me depressed and isolated.  Taking this birth control has dramatically changed my life for the better.  The only problems I have had is around Christmas, I didn't take the pill at the same time everyday and I did bleed for about a week after that.  But I no longer have cramping or bleeding at all.  Like I said, it has been absolutely wonderful.  I have not noticed any side effects, it does not seem to have effected my mood or sleep at all.

Whenever I wasn't bleeding, I was lucky. I also had severe pain with my cycles as well. I tried a low-dose birth control, and it didn't even phase my menstrual cycle. I also tried the Mirena IUD, but that caused serious complications for me. Within 1 month of the IUD insertion, my body had almost completely pushed it out of me. It also caused liquid build-up in my uterus, so I looked like I had a little baby bump. I have heard wonderful things about Mirena and do not knock it; it just didn't work for me. Then I started taking Amethyst (generic for Lybrel), and have loved it! I have been on it for approximately 6-7 years and almost never have a period. I have occasional spotting for 24-48 hours every few months, and I may have actual bleeding for a couple of days once or twice a year. It has been a life-saver!

Before birth control pills, my period would last 6 months then stop for 2 days, then start again for another 4-6 months. It was extremely heavy. I would use at least 8 ultra heavy overnight pads a day. I went to the doctor & asked for Seasonale. At the time it was new & only had brand name. I took it & 2 days later I had no period. I took it for years before having to switch to generic Seasonale, called Jolessa. Jolessa is just as good too, with a little spotting. Also I've never taken the inactive pills. I have not had a period in 7 years. Then one day I needed a refill but my pharmacy didn't have any Seasonale or Jolessa, so they called my doctor, & she gave me a free sample pack of brand name Seasonique, which is exactly the same as Seasonale, except for the last 7 pills, which I have never taken on any of the 3 birth control pills. I love brand name Seasonique. Then I recently went to my doctor for a new prescription and asked for Seasonique & was given a script.

I had no problems with either brand name, or generic Seasonale. But generic Seasonique (Amethia) is HORRIBLE.

I had my period for over a week when I started it, and doc said it would stop it. It didn't. I bled the entire month I was taking it. For others like me, the only pill that has ever worked (and I was only taken off of by my doctor for it being ""too strong"") was Mononessa. Ask about it. Different bodies need different amounts of ""hormone-control"". Find a bc that you're hormonally compatible with. From the looks of other reviews, not many people jive well with Balziva. Don't play guinea pig to whatever your doctor tells you. Pay attention to what your body needs, if Balziva or anything else prescribed for you is only doing you wrong, speak up for yourself and get what works for you. Your gyno isn't there every month going through what you are. You're your only advocate in the end.

My periods were lasting 10-12 days and I was bleeding through a tampon ever 2-3 hours. Balziva did cause me to stop having periods altogether which was a relief.

HOWEVER, within just a few months of taking it, I'd gained 15 pounds. I was an emotional wreck. I'd cry when I got stuck in traffic and was late to work. I'd cry when my dog peed on the carpet. I'd cry when the chicken came out too dry. I even cried when the employee at my bank told me I needed one extra document to change the name on my debit card after I got married. And to top it off I was ALWAYS  tired and my sex drive totally plummeted.

Finally, after about two years of taking it, I started to have occasional, sharp chest pains and really weird, unusual headaches at the base of the back of my head. They were causing me to be light headed and dizzy. During a routine checkup, my blood pressure was a little high (130/85) for someone my age (25), who works out 6 times every week. Over the next two months it began to rise until it was at 155/100 and my doctor took me off Balziva because she was worried the high dose of estrogen was going to cause a stroke. 

Its been 2 months and my blood pressure has come down considerably but I still haven't started a period. I don't know what's going to happen when my husband and I try to get pregnant.

Doubling up the pills helped me to stop in the beginning, but once I started to take them normally the period came back just as heavy and often as before.

So my doctor at first gave me Loestrin but that made me crazy.  Then I was put on Seasonique Lo, the generic version is Camerise Lo.  The first month was great! But then I got my period in the second month but it didn't last too long, my body was trying to adjust to the new medication.  So the period went away after like 6 or 7 days but now all I have is brown spotting which I hope will go away.  I am almost done with the second pack.  But I can say it did wonders with my skin and I have even lost a couple of pounds with this medicine and it also altered my mood.  When I wasn't taking this I felt like I was constantly pmsing and crazy cause of getting my period twice a month.  over all I love this pill, just waiting it out to see if the brown spotting will go away.

My purpose for this product is not birth control,as my husband has had a vasectomy, but to limit my blood loss.  I have a genetic anemia.

Well, I am now on week 10 and still spotting. I take the pill every time each night, I am going insane. It is doing the exact opposite of the reason I started taking it. I have 3 weeks to go including the low dose at the end of the pack. I saw a diff Dr. and he told me to finish the pack normally and start a new one. Honestly, I do not see the bleeding ever stopping, it went from only seeing it when I wiped for two days, to filling a panty liner, to having to use regular pads. I'm not sure if this med just isn't strong enough for me or what but I will be so happy if I ever stop bleeding. 43 days is waay too long I'd say. so far, I absolutely hate this med...",1,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  headache ,  bloating ,  breast  tenderness, swelling of the  ankles /feet (fluid retention), or  weight  change may occur.",5

Also, made me lose my appetite.
